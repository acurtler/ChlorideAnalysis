# Chloride Analysis of Twin Cities Metro Area Lakes

This project was completed as part of my Environmental Science capstone course. I worked with a partner to analyze data from the MSP Long-Term Ecological Research Project (LTER). We used R to explore temporal trends in chloride concentrations of 24 lakes in the Twin Cities Metro Area (TCMA). The 24 lakes were part of four major lake chains in the TCMA: Phalen chain, Minneapolis Parks & Recreation Board chain, Lino Lakes chain, and Riley Creek chain. We also used ArcGIS Pro to explore spatial trends in chloride concentration, including relationship between chloride concentrations and lake position in the watershed, and relationship between road density and chloride concentration. 

## How to Run This Project

To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Download the csv files to your computer.

2. Download the r scripts and Rmd files. Run these to clean the data to only show our lakes of interest and explore the data trends
